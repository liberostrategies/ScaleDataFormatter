# ScaleDataFormatter


This program takes the old wireless scale data from the 1byOne Android app
and converts it to the new ArboLeaf app format. The 1byOne app did not provide
a multi-day export.

The input files and arboleaf sample data live in /data.

The output file "datafile.csv" will be generated.
